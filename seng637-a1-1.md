# Introduction

In this lab, our team conducts exploratory, manual, and regression testing of the provided ATM simulation software, which acts as our System Under Test (SUT). This allows the team to dive deeper and gain a better understanding and differentiate the different software testing concepts outside of just "play around, break something, document, repeat." Since versions 1.0 and 1.1 is provided, the team simulates the different stages throughout an application's testing and development cycle. During the lab, the team makes use of JIRA to keep track of bugs and defects that have been found during testing.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

The primary objective of our exploratory test plan is to comprehensively assess the functionality and reliability of the ATM simulation system without predefined test cases. Our focus will be on the core functionalities: Withdrawal, Deposit, Transfer, and Balance Inquiry. We will also pay attention to secondary features such as card reading, PIN validation, session management, error handling, and receipt generation. The testing approach is designed to ensure both the basic operational integrity of the system and its behavior under various scenarios as described by the high level requirements described in the lab's Appendix B.

Our methodology integrates testing both basic and specific requirements. First, we will conduct a series of tests covering all of the basic functions to ensure that the system operates correctly for typical usage. Afterwards, we will test specific functionalities under various conditions and parameters. This includes testing edge cases such as invalid PIN entries, withdrawal limits, empty cash containers, unreadable cards, etc. The aim is to not only verify the system against its requirements but also to assess its error-handling capabilities.

Test cases will be developed based on common usage patterns and intuition, as well as potential exceptions, ensuring a in-depth evaluation of the system. These will include standard operations and various failure conditions. Our team will perform testing in pairs, one member will perform the test and the other will write the results. Continuous documentation and defect reporting will be crucial throughout the testing process.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Manual function testing involves a structured and systematic approach, we were given a list of predefined test cases to test. This had the advantage of greater traceabiity, and repeatability of the issues that were found, it was also easier to explain the issue though documentation. However the rigidity made it such that any issues found were only from the predefined test scripts, any use cases not in the test cases could have been missed if not for the exploratory functional testing. Manual function testing is also resource intensive as in there is a lot of time spent creating the test cases and it is still subject to bais by the people who made the test cases. Manual function testing is highly efficient because of the predefined test cases there is no time wasted searching for issues in a meandering way. Manual funcation testing's is highly effective but only on the issues that are present in the test cases. 

Exploratory functional testing relies upon the testers creativity to take a more flexiable apporoach to finding an issue with no set test cases to test, the issues are found naturally. This has the advantage of flexibility, as the tester is allowed to test in whatever manner they deem best. Exploratory functional testing also has the advantage of being able to find problems that are not a part of predefined list of test cases, that could be based on someones baises, this is a testiment to EFT's effectiveness in finding unexpected issues. Exploratory functional testing creates drawbacks due to its nature such as without a plan or witness, documentation and reproducability take a severe toll. The test's skills and creativity are also potential negatives as that may cause some issues to be overlooked. Exploratory functional testing may also be less efficient in finding all the defects and time its also wasted having to recall or retrace steps to reproduce for documentation. 

Applying both manual and exploratory functional testing makes sure that the benefits of one cover the drawbacks of the other. We noticed this during our own functional testing, we would reccommend doing exploratory functional testing after manual functional testing as this will ensure the least amount of rework, which is something we noticed while testing. As you can see from the attached defect report that the majority of the issues found were from the manual function testing, and exploratory functional testing found less however the exploratory functional testing found issues that were very unexpected. For example, transfering funds under $0.5 resulted in an unexpected amount to be transferred, this issue could only have been found through exploratory functional testing. 

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

The review of the defect report generated from JIRA offers notable insights that merit discussion. It highlights that out of the twelve bugs identified in version 1.0, five were rectified in the subsequent version 1.1, while seven persisted. Among those still present, most are classified as low or medium priority. However, there is an exception with ATM-4, a critical bug where $20 is erroneously dispensed from the ATM under valid input conditions. This bug has been earmarked with the highest priority for resolution in the next update. It's worth noting that the initial release had four bugs deemed 'high' or 'highest' priority, with three being addressed and resolved in version 1.1, showcasing a focused effort on mitigating the most severe issues.

The bugs were organized into six distinct 'components': session, transfer, login, withdrawal, deposit, and inquiry. This classification revealed a balanced distribution across the different components, indicating no excessive concentration in any single area of the application. Notably, bugs within the 'deposit' and 'inquiry' categories identified in version 1.0 were all addressed by version 1.1. This indicates a concerted effort to resolve issues, with the unresolved bugs now confined to the remaining four components. This distribution suggests a strategic approach to prioritizing bug fixes, with emphasis placed on resolving high-priority issues and evenly addressing defects across the software's functional areas.


# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

Test cases were completed using a peer evaluation method. In groups of two / three, team members split up to test bugs. 

One member from each team would continue through the initial state and any inputs. While the other team members would watch for any bugs in the output. Peers would also confirm the tester was following the test cases as written.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

1. Writing the steps to recreate a bug with absolute clarity was very difficult. It is easy to forget a step by thinking it is obvious what the next input should be. 

2. The ATM simulation was entertaining and easy to use. Since we know how an ATM works in reality, it was easier to catch bugs based on our experience using ATM’s.
